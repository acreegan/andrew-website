I am an engineer holding a masterâ€™s degree in Bioengineering from the University of Auckland. Over the last several years I have worked in a broad range of engineering disciplines including mechanical, electrical, and software design, and data science. I enjoy working at the crossroads between these disciplines, and I believe cross disciplinary knowledge is very helpful in realizing functional goals in product development.
