I am a mechatronics and biomedical engineer with a love for all kinds of making and measuring.  After 8 years of experience in industry, I went on to complete my PhD in bioengineering and am now looking for a role where I can make a difference. My experience has given me a combination of the cross-disciplinary skills that were needed to succeed in the world of startups, and the rigorous approach needed for scientific research.
