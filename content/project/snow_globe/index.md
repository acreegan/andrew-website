The Pohutukawa Snow Globe is an art piece that I developed. The concept is a snow globe shaped object with a pohutukawa figure inside. When a person picks up the globe and shakes it (as they would a traditional snow globe), the flowers of the pohutukawa figure gradually start to glow. When the shaking stops, the glowing fades away. 

While taking a form that many will be familiar with, the function of the pohutakawa snow globe seeks to evoke the fleeting nature of the real pohutukawa bloom. It also depicts a traditional New Zealand Christmas experience, making it perfect to take the shape of the snow globe.
