Covid19-cases.nz is a website I developed during the early days of the 2020 Covid19 lockdown in New Zealand. It features various views of the latest Covid19 data including a New Cases vs Total Cases view. First introduced to me by a Minute Physics video, the new cases vs total cases view is especially good at portraying the exponential nature of the Covid19 outbreak.

The website is written using the Dash framework for python, allowing it to feature a responsive UI coupled with pythonâ€™s ease of development.
