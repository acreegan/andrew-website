In 2022 I was commissioned to build a hologram display for the Bioengineering the Future event hosted by the Auckland Bioengineering Institute in Aucklandâ€™s waterfront. The display is a pyramid shaped pseudo-hologram based on the pepper's ghost effect. It works by using images from displays mounted above the pyramid, which reflect images off the glass and create the appearance of an object floating in mid air. This was used as a unique method to show off the research of the heart and lung groups of the ABI, especially for structural and functional  models of human organs.

The most important aspect of the design was the type of glass used. It needed to be tinted darkly to attenuate most of the reflection off the back side of the glass, in order to avoid the appearance of a double image. However, it still needed be transparent enought to see benide it to keep the illusion intact.

I modelled the frame and pyramid in Solidworks, and worked with local suppliers to have them manufacture. Four portable displays were mounted on top of the frame. These needed to be controlled synchronously to play the video visible from all four sides of the pyramid. This was accomplished with an Intel NUC portable PC capable for four separate video outputs.
