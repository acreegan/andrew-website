Lime Aid is a mobile app concept I developed in 2018. The concept is an app to augment and extend the functionality available to the workers who collect and charge Lime scooters (or other e-scooter and e-bike brands). As these companies function using a gig economy model, the workers are regular people, not employees of the companies. The app could help plan efficient routes to collect multiple scooters and could even help broker agreements on how the available scooters would be shared amongst the workers. To start developing the project, I reverse engineered the private API used by the Lime app so that I could create a custom mobile app using it. The project is currently in development hiatus
